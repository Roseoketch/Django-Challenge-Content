# Django-Challenge-Content

#### This is a project that helps to highlight the challenges faced by students when tackling Django content possible solutions.

#### For checking django version version after rnning the python3.6 shell, instead of using ** django_get.version use django.VERSION **

#### Instead of having two options on how to start django project we should have one with the dot at the end for good project structure alignment and to avoid confusing the students who might be new to coding or meeting django for the first time.

#### While importing views from the app(news) to urls in news ** from . import views ** instead of the dot(.) replace it with the name of the app (news) it should be (from news import views)
